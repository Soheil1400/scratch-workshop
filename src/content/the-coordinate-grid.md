title: 'The Coordinate Grid'
---

Every position on the canvas has a number.

- `x` is right and left.
- `y` is up and down.
- If you want to move right, increase `x`.
- If you want to move left, decrease `x`.
- If you want to move up, increase `y`.
- If you want to move down, decrease `y`.

Understanding how the coordinate grid works is all great and wonderful, but we probably want to use it to place stuff, right?

Once we have a feel for how the grid works, it probably makes sense to look at [how to move our sprites around](basic-movements-part-i)â€”using code!
