title: 'Adding A Character To The Falling Game'
---

So, right now, we just have falling apples. That's not much of a game. Can you add an additional sprite? I chose **Pico Walking** as my sprite, but you can chose something else if you want. The character should have the following behaviors:

- The sprite should be able to walk left and right using the arrow keys.
- The sprite should change costumes as it walks.
- The sprite should fall to the ground.

After you try it out, we'll take a look at my solution [here](./adding-a-character-to-the-falling-game-solution).
