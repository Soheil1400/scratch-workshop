title: 'Creating A Sprite'
---

For our game, we're going to need a sprite. I guess we can use one of the premade ones, but I wanted to make my own. Take a few minutes and make one for yourself. It needs to meet the following requirements for our game.

- It should be relatively the same height and width. You can hold down **Shift** when you're making a shape and you should a perfectly even shape.
- Aim for around 35 pixels in both height and width.
- You want to make sure that it snaps to that little point in the center.
- It should be facing right.

As long as it meets those requirements, you should be good to go!

The little plus sign is the center point and you can rotate the sprite if you need to!

You can see the height and width of the costume in the sidebar.

With all of that in place, let's look at [Combining Movement and the Game Loop](combining-movement-and-the-game-loop).
